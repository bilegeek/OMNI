# OMNI
Soon-to-be Unofficial Mirror of OMNI Print Driver Model (latest release)

# LICENSE
The driver is licensed under LGPL v2.0, but Github won't go below LGPL v2.1, so I couldn't choose the license. The Epson portion is released under the "SEIKO EPSON CORPORATION SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT", which actually is included within that folder. I am not sure under what license the Documentation is released under.
